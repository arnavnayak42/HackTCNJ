This project is a collabartive idea made by Arnav Nayak, Arjun Ravikumar, Ethen Chou, and Kevin Yarramsetty. We incorporated data from the python YFinance framework to pull current and past data on specific stocks asked for by the user. We created an algorithm using a 50 Day and 20 Day moving average value, to be able to let the user know the best investing and selling point of the stock selected by them. We have marked these by up and down arrows. We used a complex Linear Regression model to be able to predict future stock values based on the trends observed by the past increases and decreases in the stock value. Finally we put all these values on a graph for an easy to view tool for the user. Thank you and enjoy!
